## Introduction

What is this paper about?

This paper is based on the lecture "Reproducibility"  from the MSB105 Data Science at the Western Norway University of Applied Sciences, and explores the question, "Is Reproducibility Good Enough?"

What is discussed?


Why is it of any consequence?

Science builds on prior results.  
If published findings cannot be trusted, both future research and policy decisions risk being misguided [@ioannidis2005].  
In medicine, irreproducible results waste resources and delay treatments [@begley2012].  


## Literature review

Smart stuff from others about the topic.

Use a least 20 citations, a least 5 of them must be new (not from the provided .bib file).

Use both in-line and normal citations.

Example:

@gentleman2005 argues that bla bla bla.
On the other hand it's claimed that bla bla [@barbalorenaa.2018; @bartlett2008].

## Discussion of the reseach question

-   Should replicability be the norm or is this to much to ask for now?
-   Can Quarto documents help with reproducibility?
-   What problems remains and how can these be solved?
