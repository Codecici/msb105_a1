## Introduction

What is this paper about?

This paper is based on the lecture "Reproducibility"  from the MSB105 Data Science at the Western Norway University of Applied Sciences, and explores the question, "Is Reproducibility Good Enough?"

What is discussed?




Why is it of any consequence?

Science builds on prior results.  
If published findings cannot be trusted, both future research and policy decisions risk being misguided [@ioannidis2005].  
In medicine, irreproducible results waste resources and delay treatments [@begley2012].  
Therefore, ensuring reproducibility and replicability is essential for maintaining scientific credibility and for enabling progress across disciplines.  

## Literature review

1. Science advances on a foundation of trusted discoveries, but some reports indicate that a significant portion of research findings cannot be reproduced [@mcnutt2014].


2. @peng2011 argues reproducibility is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for replicability. Without reproducibility, there can be no replicability. Reproducibility has already become a critical issue in the scientific community.

3. @bollen2015 emphasizes that robust and reliable scientific research must satisfy three fundamental criteria. First, reproducibility requires that researchers can obtain consistent results when using the same original data and analytical procedures. Second, replicability demands that independent researchers following the same methodological protocols but collecting new data should arrive at substantively consistent findings. Finally, generalizability examines whether research conclusions remain valid when applied to different contexts, populations, or conditions beyond the original study setting.






Smart stuff from others about the topic.

Use a least 20 citations, a least 5 of them must be new (not from the provided .bib file).

Use both in-line and normal citations.

Example:

@gentleman2005 argues that bla bla bla.
On the other hand it's claimed that bla bla [@barbalorenaa.2018; @bartlett2008].

## Discussion of the reseach question

-   Should replicability be the norm or is this to much to ask for now?
-   Can Quarto documents help with reproducibility?
-   What problems remains and how can these be solved?
